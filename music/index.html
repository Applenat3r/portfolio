	<h2>Influences</h2>
	  <li>My family and friends have been my influence. My brother especially was someone I looked up to when I was younger to do more musicals
	  and singing oppurtunities. My mom has also been a big help, she has taught me how to sing with good tone and blending. My friends introduced
	  me to listening to more genres of music, like pop, indie, rock, rap, and country.</li>
	  <h2>Experience</h2>
	  <li>I started to play in a band class in 7th grade. I also joined choir at the school in 7th grade. I was in band until sophomore year then
	  I quit. I still play the instrument, I just play by myself now. Im still in choir at school, and I really like to sing in school choirs
	  like this. I have been doing musicals since I was 5. But I have ended up not like to audition for them anymore so I haven't tried out
	  yet this year 2026. I love listening to music especially in my car. I like fixing the equalizer to make the bass loud in my car and it's
	  fun to go on night drives while listeniing to my favorite tunes.</li>
